write tests: 
    client 
maybe add assertions and typing to the encryption module 
make sure printTransactions works as intended for subclasses, ordered by date w/ separate lines 
if printTransactions works as intended, write and read file should as well, but make sure 
when we're done, put in the updated documentation 

notes: 
.isalpha() excludes numbers, so you can't include numbers in the street 

questions for mcmanus:
is the overdraft $ limit for savingsaccount 250 
specific logic in the reduction of overdraft counter in savings account  
do we need to test the encryption module
do we have to make bankaccuont abstract or can we just have it intended to not be called directly 
can i call the bankaccount class to test the constructor assert
how should we implement equality and comparisons since you can have multiple of the same account num now 
specifics of how closeAccount is implemented, where do the funds go ? 
do we have to test the encryption and writing to files 
what do you want in the class header comments 
is it ok to round in the interest test bc of float inaccuracy
