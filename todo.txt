write tests: 
    bankaccount (many need to be rewritten / added)
    client 
    savingsaccount
    checkingaccount
    address

make sure printTransactions works as intended for subclasses, ordered by date w/ separate lines 
if printTransactions works as intended, write and read file should as well, but make sure 

notes: 
.isalpha() excludes numbers, so you can't include numbers in the street 

qs:
can i call the bankaccount class to test the constructor 
how should we implement equality since you can have multiple of the same account num now 
do we have to include the silly debug print statements in tests 
specifics of how closeAccount is implemented, where do the funds go ?
