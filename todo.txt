write tests: 
    bankaccount (many need to be rewritten / added)
    client 
    savingsaccount
    checkingaccount
    address

notes: 
.isalpha() excludes numbers, so you can't include numbers in the street 

do we have to include the silly debug print statements in tests 
specifics of how closeAccount is implemented, where do the funds go ?
